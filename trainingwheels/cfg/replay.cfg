// To enable replay, modify this file, and either replay_local_http.cfg or replay_ftp.cfg (see below), then
// run your server with something like:
//
//    srcds -game tf -console +exec replay.cfg
//
// The replay system will do a sanity check at startup to help you debug any issues.
//

// Enable replay!
replay_enable "1"

// How often we dump replay data.  You should not need to modify this value.
replay_block_dump_interval "15"

// This is the method by which clients download replay data.  At the moment, only HTTP is available.
replay_fileserver_protocol "http"

//
// NOTE: UNCOMMENT *ONE* OF THE FOLLOWING TWO 'EXEC' LINES, AND MAKE SURE YOU EDIT THE CORRESPONDING FILE.
//
// - The "local HTTP" method requires that you run a web server on the same machine as your game server.
// - The "FTP" method allows you to offload replay data to another machine (which must be running a web
//   server) over FTP.  Clients will download their replay data over HTTP.
//

exec replay_local_http.cfg
//exec replay_ftp.cfg
